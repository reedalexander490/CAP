# Cold Atmospheric Plasma

## Description
This project involves an experimental setup designed to automatically control the voltage, flow rate, location, and frequency of a cold atmospheric plasma jet. The system aims to facilitate research in the field of plasma technology for educational purposes.

## Technologies Used
- **LabVIEW**: For system control and data acquisition.
- **PowerShell**: For scripting and automation tasks.
- **Python**: Used for generating command scripts for LabVIEW.
- **MATLAB**: For data analysis and graphing.
- **Power Electronics**: For managing electrical components.
- **LTSpice**: For circuit simulation.
- **KiCAD**: For PCB design.

## Installation Instructions
This project is proprietary for educational research purposes, and therefore, it is not available for public installation.

## Usage
Commands for controlling the plasma jet are generated using a command script generator in Python. These commands are then fed into LabVIEW through a delimited spreadsheet format.

## Contributing
Currently, there are no guidelines for contributions, as this project is proprietary and intended for educational research only.

## License
This project does not have a specified license.
